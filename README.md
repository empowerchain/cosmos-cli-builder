# Cosmos CLI builder

This repo holds binaries for many different cosmos chains.

It is essentially a Go script that fetches up-to-date information from the brilliant cosmos.directory API's and builds binaries from source for as many platforms and architectures as possible. This doesn't always work.

The lastest binaires can be found here: https://github.com/empowerchain/cosmos-cli-builder/releases/tag/latest
